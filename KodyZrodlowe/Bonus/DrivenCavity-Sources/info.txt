Whoaaa... Its about 8 years now when it was written...

Finally I decided to publish it free on the web as I get quite a large
demand on shating them.

Enjoy and happy coding,

This text document explains some technical details about source Codes for the 
article:

Matyka, M.,"Solution to two-dimensional Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations
with SIMPLE, SIMPLER and Vorticity-Stream Function Approaches. Driven-Lid
Cavity Problem: Solution and Visualization.", CFD Project Report #1, 15.II.2003

Article is available on the web page of the author:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an archive DrivenCavitySources.zip you will find three different source codes
for three different solvers to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Sources 
were made by me for the course: "TMV053 Computational Fluid Mechanics" on University 
of Linkoping in Sweden during my exchange studies in 2003.


Sources which you get from me are made only to illustrate implementation of 
theory which has been shown in article which is lited below. No especially focus 
has been made to produce "high level" software from it, but I hope (I am sure, 
and I hope) that you will find in that sources some implementation help.


It is important, that people who want to use the sources in science calculations
have to consider boundary conditions, which were used in the codes. I am sure,
that boundary conditions for DRIVEN CAVITY problem are good, since I checked it
(it was a subject of my project work). But for other type of calculations (like
"wind tunnel" fluid flow, etc.) new boundary conditions should be implemented in
function:

void ApplyBoundaryConditions(double **p, double **u, double **v)

in drivencavity.cpp file (or analogue in other solvers).

Implementation details
----------------------

I used .cpp files to handle c code. It is just more convenient for me, to use
.cpp compiler, bacause of not important for you, reasons. However, you can 
easly rewrite codes to "c" language, since I am not using "classes" and other 
typical .cpp stuff. But, some .cpp style commands (like include <stdio>) shoud 
be rewrited to .c analogues. Please contact me, if you really need .c code of 
the solver and you have problem with rewriting it.

However - please compile .cpp files. I am using MSVisual Studio 6.0 to compile 
solvers.

Attention: after you compile the files, please make directory "frames/" in
directory, where solver.exe file is placed. In an archive you can find three 
different solvers source codes:

SIMPLE SOLVER In directory Simple/
SIMPLER SOLVER In directory Simpler/
VORTICITY - STREAM FUNCTION SOLVER in directory VorticityStream/

Codes which I give you there are configured (physical properties and boundary
conditions) to handle typical test cases of Driven-Lid Cavity problem. You can
recognize some physical values (i.e. Reynolds number) in source codes. To 
change physical properties and to select visualization procedure, use main file 
(drivencavity...cpp). To change visualization procedures, you can use 
visual.cpp file.

I hope you will succesfully compile and run my codes, and I hope it will be 
useful for you. It will be very nice to know, that somebody is using my 
codes, so let me know.
